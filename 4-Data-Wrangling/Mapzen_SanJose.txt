Mapzen has unfortunately closed down since 1st Feb and I am not sure how to retrieve the link.

Originally, I chose Singapore as it is where I stay now.
However, the roads here are named in two languages and it adds some difficulty to the project.

Then, I moved to Los Angeles where I used to stay for a few years.
I was excited to explore the city as it remains my most favorite city.
Yet, the large .osm file size of 8GB stopped me from pursuing as parsing through the whole document will take more than few hours.

San Jose becomes the most logical option since it has the smallest file size in North America and it is the home to lots of companies that I wish to work for.
